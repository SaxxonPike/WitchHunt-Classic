# WitchHunt-Classic
The "WitchHunt" addon, revived for WoW Classic.

### What is it?

This is a port of the WitchHunt spell alert addon to WoW Classic. The last official update to the addon was in 2009.
 
### Tell me more!

WitchHunt will warn you when someone is casting a spell or gains an ability.

Example: Ammo begins to cast Powers of Death

You can configure WitchHunt through: Esc -> Interface Options -> AddOns
Or open the configuration with /wh or /witchhunt

### What's left to port to Classic?

- On-screen alerts are fully functioning.
- The per spell/ability filtering feature does not yet work.
- Many of the new features have text that is not yet localized. Any help is greatly appreciated!

### How can I help?

As the base for this addon is not my own creation, I will not be accepting donations for it. However, if you know a bit of Lua and would like to contribute, send me a pull request sometime with your improvements!
